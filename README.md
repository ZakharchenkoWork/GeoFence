## Tutorial:
I have made usage of this App as easy as possible.
Just enter coordinates to the fields, or simply press "current" button.
App can ask for permissions, GPS and WIFI enabled at this point or later.
Enter radius for the fence in meters, and name of the wifi network.
Then just press "start" button, and your phone will start watching around to find out are you inside the fence or not.
